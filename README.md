**Welcome to Dad Jokes, Cats, and Podcasts!**

DCJP is my React project for Code Louisville. It is a web app designed to consume and utilize three different APIs, each of which is contained in its own component. You can use it to pull up a random dad joke, a random cat picture, or search for a podcast contained in a database built by a colleague of mine!

This project requires React to run, so be sure to install NPM through the terminal of your choice via the 'npm install'. Take care in ensuring you have the following dependencies installed by checking out your package.json file:

* bootstrap
* react
* react-dom
* react-router-dom
* react-scripts

Once you make sure those are installed, you can open the project via the 'npm start' command. The project should open in a locally hosted browser window!

Thanks for checking out my project!
